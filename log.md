# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 20 June 2020

**Today's Progress**: Planned what I am going to do for the challenge - working through the content and tutorials in [i]Mastering Machine Learning for Penetration Testing[/i] by Chiheb Chebbi ([Kindle link:](https://read.amazon.com.au/kp/kshare?asin=B07CSN7QQ1&id=QHSWWvxaREGnhO8MOKuj1g&reshareId=NWJ5D150EP9SWGK4X9J2&reshareChannel=system). Also began reading the introductory parts. 

**Thoughts:** There is a lot of material and a lot of topics covered - I'm especially interested in the malware detection and automated analysis techniques.

**Link to work:** See link to Kindle book above. I searched through a bunch of resources, reviewed my notes re: automated malware analysis from the malware reverse engineering course I did in my Masters degree and read through the introductory parts of the above book. I also made sure I had CUDA, Python and everything else installed on my PC. Didn't write any actual code today, but got everything ready for me to do so.
